This GitHub repertory include 10 Mplus programs to identify 
multimorbidity trajectories over a 10-year period, from 2010 to 2019.

The dependent variable is the yearly prevalent count of chronic conditions 
each year during the 10-year period. This variable is Poisson distributed

Each program estimates an LCGA model, where the number of trajectories range from 1 to 10.
